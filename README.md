# Blog Post API using Django Rest Framework

- We want to return the available enpoints when base endpoint is hit
  Base endpoint is /post-api/

- Using class based views for CRUD operations.

- We want to use ModelSerializer to demonstrate 'list all posts', 'show single post', 'create-post', 'update-post', 'delete-post' using ModelSerializer class provided by DRF

- This also demonstrates the usage of HTTP status code along with Response.
